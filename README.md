# CryptoFig_B2
This code will produce a  figure that demonstrates that we can successfully transform and do complementation in Cryptococcus, to argue that we should be able to do similar experiments with Ssd1. The Gat201 complementation is the best evidence that we have for that.
A short 3-panel figure showing:
A. Overview of CryptoMobius for gene complementation
B. Simple evidence that we complemented a Gat201 phenotype - I think if there are some clear growth curve or colony assays from @Liz Hughes? The one on the Jan seminar is nice but a bit complicated, too many replicate lines to be clear for a grant application.
C. (maybe) One clear panel showing that we can express a fluorescent protein using CryptoMobius? Microscopy or flow or colonies on plates are fine.
